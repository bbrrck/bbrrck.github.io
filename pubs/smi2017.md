{:.imgCaption}
Sensor-instrumented devices used for data acquisition.  
**Left**: a custom-made prototype (Morphorider).
**Right**: a standard smartphone.

{:.imgCaption}
The
<span style="color:#555">mushroom</span>
network created from scratch entirely with a smartphone.
Curve lengths were estimated from acquisition time.

<span style="color:#555">Guitar</span>
and
<span style="color:#555">bathtub</span>
scanned using the Morphorider. Left to right, reconstructed networks, surfaces computed from the networks, the scanned objects.
The
<span style="color:#555">guitar</span>
shape was created by extruding the surfaced network.

{:.imgCaption}
Inspired by the image on the right, we created a 3D model of the
<span style="color:#555">sailboat</span>
by sketching the network on the left with a smartphone. The lengths were estimated from time of acquisition.
