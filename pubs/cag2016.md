<h2 style="padding:2em 0 1em;">Supplementary material</h2>

The following is a comparison of <a href="http://haopan.github.io/curvenet_surfacing.html">[Pan et al., 2015]</a> (left surfaces)
with our method (right surfaces). These figures are not a part of our paper.

To better see the differences between the computed surfaces, we use normal mapping on a circle-symmetric texture as shown below.
This texture is useful for examining continuity, regularity and symmetry of the reconstructed shapes.

The algorithm of [Pan et al.] does not preserve the symmetry of the input network in the computed surface.
Our algorithm keeps the symmetry: the final textured surfaces are fairly regular and the circles are preserved in the texture.
