<blockquote>To know one's state is not a simple matter. One cannot look directly at one's own face with one's own eyes, for example. One has no choice but to look at one's reflection in the mirror. Thruogh experiences, we come to believe that the image is correct, but that is all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[&hellip;] sometimes you've got to just stop and take time. You ought to train yourself  to look at things with your own eyes until something comes clear.

<blockquote>If I can give an abstract proof of something, I'm reasonably happy. But if I can get a concrete, computational proof and actually produce numbers I'm much happier. I'm rather an addict of doing things on the computer, because that gives you an explicit criterion of what's going on. I have a visual way of thinking, and I'm happy if I can see a picture of what I'm working with.</blockquote>
