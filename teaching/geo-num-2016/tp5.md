## Uniform B-splines
In [TP3](/teaching/geo-num-2016/tp3.html), you have implemented the De Boor's algorithm for evaluation of general B-splines.
Now, let's have a look at a particular subclass of B-spline curves, characterized by the uniform knot vector $t_i = i \; \; \forall i \in \mathbb Z$;
have a look at the [basis](tp3.html#uniform_bspline_basis) induced by such vector.

Your today's task will be to implement these *uniform B-splines* as subdivision curves.

## Subdivision algorithm

For a given degree $k$, the following constitutes one subdivision step
passing from a polygon with $p$ points
    $\left\lbrace x_i^n \right\rbrace_{i=0}^{p-1}$
to a polygon with $2p$ points
    $\left\lbrace x_i^{n+1} \right\rbrace_{i=0}^{2p-1}$.

### Double the points :

$$
d_{2i}^0 = x_i^n, \quad d_{2i+1}^0 = x_i^n  \quad \text{for} \quad i=0,\dots,p-1
$$

{:.lightblue}
### Average $k$ times :

$$
d_i^j = \frac12 \left( d_i^{j-1} + d_{i+1}^{j-1} \right) \quad \text{for} \quad j=1,\dots,k
$$

{:.lightblue}
### Replace :

$$
x_i^{n+1} = d_i^k  \quad \text{for} \quad i=0,\dots,2p-1
$$

With increasing degree, the Stanford bunny becomes smoother and smoother. Here, the degree runs from 2 to 20 and back.


## ToDo
1. Implement the subdivision algorithm for (closed) uniform B-spline curves. Test with various values of the degree $k$.
2. Simplify the scheme for $k=2$. What do you observe?
