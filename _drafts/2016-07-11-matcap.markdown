Outline
- isophotes, reflection lines, matcap (material capture) = lit sphere

Intro
- surface interrogation, why?

Isophotes and reflection lines
- what are they?
- history (automotive)
- differences
- examples

Matcap
- what is it?
- relation to environment mapping, normal mapping?
- when used?
- using these for surface interrogration: what textures are good?
- lit spheres paper + siggraph GP paper (I got to the first through the second)

GLSL Implementation
- glsl implementation: https://www.clicktorelease.com/blog/creating-spherical-environment-mapping-shader

Examples
- test various objects and various textures
